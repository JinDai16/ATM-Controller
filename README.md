# ATM-Controller
C++-based implementation of a simple ATM

Purpose: Write code for a simple ATM. It doesn't need any UI (either graphical or console), but a controller should be implemented and tested.

Functional Requirements:
1. Checking account balance (both checking and savings accounts)
2. Make transfers between the two accounts
3. Make deposits into accounts (both checking and savings accounts)
4. Make withdrawals from accounts (both checking and savings accounts)

Assumption: For simplification, there are only 1 dollar bills in this world, no cents. Thus account balance can be represented in integer.
